    "In the following notebook, I will be examining the Los Angeles data city catalog's [Arrests from 2010 to Present](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-Present/yru6-6re4) csv file which contains roughly 1.2 million arrests. The dataset is provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Each row is the booking of an arrestee, and each column contains details about the arrest incident. For the purpose of this project, I will only examine marijuana related arrests by applying a filter to the `Charge Description` if it contains the word 'marijuana'. \n",
